# VRisingServerApiPlugin
 VRising Server API used to expose new HTTP Routes

This plugin is to be embedded in [v-rising-server](https://github.com/hermesdj/v-rising-server)

This is still in active development !

Infinite thanks to [DarkAtra project on his discord bot](https://github.com/DarkAtra/v-rising-discord-bot-companion) for the inspiration on how to do this

## TODO

Look how to automatically release the plugin using the following github workflows :
- https://github.com/DarkAtra/v-rising-discord-bot-companion/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml
- https://github.com/DarkAtra/v-rising-discord-bot-companion/blob/main/publish.sh
